./jpegtochat for help suckas

if u cant figure this fool out, oh well.

dr. adam o. for jpeg codes since libjpeg doesnt have documentation.

some issues with display may be caused from the fact that if you use
screen and even though your term supports xterm colors, the term type
isnt set right and they are workin, or maybe your term doesnt really
support x-term colors. in either cause, if your client isnt mirc, then
use -c ansi cause that is pretty consistent across all unix-based
ansi-supporting clients

also, if whatever it is that you are using supports bold ansi bg colors
in leiu of blinking ansi text, then you can use the -c ansiplus to get
a larger color palette.

if you only specify -x or -y it will resize the other dimension
accordingly taking into account the font aspect ratio also

safeansi mode means it doesnt use ansi bold, this makes this client the
most universal -c option.  mirc doesnt support ansi colors tho. this
-c will work if you are having trouble with irssi/silc -c mode as your
terminal might not be set TERM=tty or some other reason xterm colors
are not showing up. safeansi sacrifices considerable color depth but
at least it will work on the most irc clients simultaneously.

CONFIG FILE SHIT!

i support config files now also, to check them out look at j2crc.mirc or
j2crc.ansi if you are in a unix terminal just fuckin move j2crc.ansi to
$HOME/.j2crc and make sure yuo have a terminal font installed or edit the
file and chagne the font 

the config file format is exactly like command line parameters
