this is a nice boat

i would like to mention how to compile this but i'm not sure myself
the .sln file should work if you're in windows otherwise idk idc
links against perl boost openssl and libjpeg
you also might need to do some ghetto shit like getting a windows getopt port or something

shoutz to aempirei for writing jpegtochat shit owns

also in case you didn't realize even if you were to get this to compile all the cool features require data files that are not provided with brobot good luck getting your hand on them
